Quick Guide:
design.md and whys.md talk about what I'm up to here.

play_grid and game_engine are a fully implemented "Game" of minesweeper, including ascii board outputs (but no UI)

player_state, player_cell and player_engine represent the tools being made available to players -- we will then build
actual players on top of this.  The goal is to have three:
1. Rules-Based programmatic Engine
2. Human interaction engine
3. AI engine (of some sort)

After this, we will do some stats as well, to evaluate them
