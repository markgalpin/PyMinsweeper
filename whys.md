Shlommi taught me at JFrog, as a product manager to always be asking "why?"
So Here's my whys:
1.) I think it will be a fun and interesting way to keep my coding from getting too rusty
2.) If I can properly encapsulate all the deterministic rules of minecraft and/or discover new ones, I might become a better player of the game.
3.) I would like to play around with GPU-computing, and this problem seems like a very promising one for it.
4.) There's lots of optimal strategy questions to explore in the program itself
5.) It could be fun to teach an AI to play, and teaching an AI from different starting points could help me think better about how to use ML-type tools.
6.) Think more deeply about the probability portion of minesweeper
7.) Depending on what I find, possibly publish an app for other people to do it (would get to play with appstore)

Some other whys:
Why not use open source?  For right now, I want to play with the coding.  Even the UI.  But I might eventually take an OSS version if I want to build an app or something.
